# Late Delivery Analysis for Olist Brazilian dataset

## Business Problem
Late deliveries are a critical operational issue in e-commerce, directly impacting customer satisfaction, seller reputation, and repeat purchase behavior.

Using the Olist Brazilian e-commerce dataset, this project aims to identify:
- Where late deliveries occur most frequently (by state and seller)
- Which stage of the order lifecycle contributes most to delays (shipping vs final delivery)
- Whether late deliveries are driven by systemic regional issues or by seller-level performance differences

The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help:
- Operations teams prioritize process improvements
- Marketplace managers identify high-risk sellers
- Logistics teams focus on the most delay-prone stages of fulfillment
